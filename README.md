# Landing-Page
This is a project to  create a website for an animal pound and no, it is not an actual website, clearly.

The objective of this project is to deepen the understading of CSS and specifically, the flexbox part of it. 
Another not-so-minor objective is to look fancy while coding in a coffee shop so...I'm working on it.

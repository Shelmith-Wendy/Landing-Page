            <h3><u>Lost and Found Animals</u></h3>
            <p>The shelter will hold the pet for a few days and give the owner a chance to claim it.
                If the pet is not claimed, it will usually be placed for adoption.<br><br>
               If your pet has been impounded,all fees must be paid before the animal is released.Infringements may apply for all animal related offences.<br>
               Payment plans will not be accepted, and all fees and charges must be paid in full prior to release.</p>

            <h3><u>Donate a pet</u></h3>
            <p>We understand that sometimes pet owners believe they cannot keep their pet.
               If you have exhausted all other options, you can surrender your pet to the Purgatory Paws Shelter.
               The shelter accepts all animals from residents of the town.<br><br>
               You will need an appointment, and there is no fee to surrender, 
               although we always accept donations to offset the cost of caring for the animals.
               Please provide as much information as you can about your pet; 
               the more information we have from the previous owner, the easier it is to place the pet into a new home.<br><br>
               We are not able to notify you of your surrendered pet's status, but you are welcome to email <i>purgpaws@gmail.com</i> to inquire about their status.
               We cannot give out information about the pet's new adopters.<br> <button type="button" onclick="alert('Does not work. Sorry!')">Donate a pet</button></p>

             <h3><u>Fund the shelter</u></h3>
             <p>Every animal shelter has bills to pay and your generous monetary donation will be gratefully accepted.
                Help all creatures great and small by making a monthly or single gift. 
                Your support will help us to continue to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome animals every day.<br>
